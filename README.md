# AI-driven Image to Music Playlist Generator

## Overview
"Picture to Playlist" is a novel project aimed at bridging visual and auditory experiences. By analyzing the sentiment and attributes of an image through AI, it generates a corresponding music playlist. This project leverages deep learning techniques for image sentiment analysis and integrates with music APIs, such as Spotify, for playlist curation.

## Features
- **Image Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizes deep learning to extract sentiment tags from images based on colors and objects.
- **Playlist Curation**: Matches the generated sentiment tags with songs to create a fitting playlist.

## Objectives
- Bridge the gap between visual inputs and auditory outputs.
- Provide a unique way to generate music playlists that reflect the mood or sentiment of an image.

## Technologies
- Deep Learning for image analysis.
- Spotify API for accessing music tracks.

## Approach
Adopting the Agile methodology, the project progresses through data collection, model development, API integration, and user interface design, with iterative feedback to refine the system.

## Evaluation
The effectiveness of the music recommendation is gauged through user feedback on the alignment of the playlist with the image's sentiment.
